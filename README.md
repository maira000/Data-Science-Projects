# Task 1

Customer Segmentation for a Retail Store:
Objective: Use transaction data to segment customers
based on their purchasing behavior.
Description: Analyze historical sales data to identify
distinct groups of customers. This can help in targeted
marketing strategies, personalized promotions, and
improving customer retention.
Key Steps:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means)
Visualization of customer segments


# Task 2

Predicting House Prices:
 Objective: Build a model to predict house prices based on
various features.
 Description: Use a dataset containing information about
houses (e.g., size, number of bedrooms, location) to create a
predictive model that estimates the price of a house.
Key Steps:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Feature engineering
Model selection and training (e.g., linear regression)
Model evaluation and fine-tuning


# Task 3

Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Posts:

 Objective: Determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of social
media posts about a specific product or brand.
 Description: Collect and analyze social media data (e.g., tweets, Facebook
posts) to
gauge public opinion and sentiment about a product or brand.

 Key Steps:
o Data collection using APIs
o Text preprocessing (e.g., tokenization, removing stop words)
o Sentiment analysis using NLP techniques (e.g., VADER, BERT)
o Visualization of sentiment trends


# Task 4

Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic:

 Objective: Detect anomalies in network traffic that may
indicate potential security breaches.
 Description: Analyze network traffic data to identify patterns
and detect anomalies that could signify cyber threats or
unusual activities.
 Key Steps:
o Data collection and preprocessing
o Feature extraction (e.g., packet size, time intervals)
o Anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest,
Autoencoders)
o Evaluation and validation of detected anomalies
