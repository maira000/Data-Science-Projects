Predicting House Prices:

 Objective: Build a model to predict house prices based on
various features.

 Description: Use a dataset containing information about
houses (e.g., size, number of bedrooms, location) to create a
predictive model that estimates the price of a house.

Key Steps:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature engineering

Model selection and training (e.g., linear regression)

Model evaluation and fine-tuning
